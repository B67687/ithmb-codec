## Public Sample File Sources

Live .ithmb file sources used for testing:

- **Jakarade.com** (F00–F08) — [https://www.jakarade.com/inc/Picture/yugioh/iPod Photo Cache/](https://www.jakarade.com/inc/Picture/yugioh/iPod%20Photo%20Cache/) — ✅ 227 files, 210–346 KB each, T-prefix with embedded JPEG+EXIF
- **Florida Atlantic University** (F00–F50) — [https://home.fau.edu/schilitj/web/iPod Photo Cache/](https://home.fau.edu/schilitj/web/iPod%20Photo%20Cache/) — ⚠️ ~500 files, ~672 KB each, directories live but downloads return 404
- **Hungrypoint.com** — [Photo Database](https://hungrypoint.com/Niki/iPod%20Photo%20Cache/Photo%20Database) — ✅ 30 KB index file (no .ithmb)
- **File Juicer sample** (T117.ithmb.zip) — [sample-files/T117.ithmb.zip](https://echoone.com/filejuicer/sample-files/T117.ithmb.zip) — Non-standard file (67,696 bytes `80 10` pattern + 726,344 bytes unknown); correctly rejected by our codec

Dead sources (listed for completeness): `dragonnorth.com` (empty directories), `vhromanov.com` (domain gone), `home.fau.edu/schilitj/` (redirected).

## Academic References

No formal academic papers describe the `.ithmb` format itself. The most relevant publication:

> Piccinelli M., Gubian P. (2011). _"Exploring the iPhone Backup Made by iTunes."_ Journal of Digital Forensics, Security & Law, 6(3). [DOI: 10.15394/jdfsl.2011.1099](https://doi.org/10.15394/jdfsl.2011.1099) — Open Access

This paper describes the iTunes backup structure containing .ithmb files.

---

## Color Conversion

- YCbCr → RGB uses **ITU-R BT.601** matrix (JPEG full-range variant), per [Recommendation ITU-R BT.601-7](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.601).
- RGB565 → RGB888 uses **MSB replication** (standard in FFmpeg, libpng, Skia).

## Privacy Note

Public sample files are hosted on personal and university servers and may contain personal photographs. **Do not redistribute the .ithmb files themselves.** The synthetic encoder generates test files without privacy concerns.

## License Note

The original IthmbDecoder reference implementation (ImageGlass PR [#2316](https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/pull/2316)) was GPL-3.0. This plugin is a clean-room implementation for the v10 SDK ABI, informed by format behavior described in that PR but using no GPL code. The codebase is MIT-licensed — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).
