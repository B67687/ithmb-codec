# What Is This?

This is a pure Rust codec for Apple's `.ithmb` thumbnail format — used as a Rust library, a standalone CLI tool, or as an [ImageGlass plugin](https://github.com/B67687/ImageGlass-Ithmb-Plugin) on Windows.

## What's an .ithmb File?

When you sync photos to an iPod, iPhone, or iPod Touch via iTunes, the device creates small thumbnail versions of your photos and stores them in `.ithmb` files. These files live in the device's internal storage under `PhotoData/Thumbnails/` (or a similar path).

There are two kinds:

- **T-prefix** files (like `T1024_1.ithmb`) — contain a regular JPEG image inside. These are straightforward to decode.
- **F-prefix** files (like `F1019_1.ithmb`) — contain raw pixel data in various Apple-specific formats. These are the hard ones.

## What Does the Codec Do?

It reads an `.ithmb` file and converts it to a normal image (BGRA pixels). You can use it as a [Rust library crate](https://crates.io/crates/ithmb-core), as a standalone CLI tool, or as an [ImageGlass plugin](https://github.com/B67687/ImageGlass-Ithmb-Plugin).

The logic goes:

1. Look for a JPEG inside the file (check the first few bytes for JPEG markers). If found, extract and decode the JPEG.
2. If no JPEG, check the file's 4-byte prefix against a list of known profiles. Each profile describes the image dimensions, pixel format, and encoding. Pick the matching decoder and run it.
3. If the file starts with `mhfd`, it's a PhotoDB/ArtworkDB database — parse the chunk structure, find the thumbnail entries, and decode each one.
4. If nothing matches, reject the file.

## What's a Profile?

A profile is a set of settings that tells the decoder how to interpret a raw .ithmb file. Each profile has:

- A **format ID** — a number like 1019 or 1024 that identifies the image format
- **Width and height** — the image dimensions
- An **encoding** — which pixel format to use (RGB565, RGB555, ReorderedRGB555, UYVY, YCbCr420, CLCL, or CL)
- Various flags — things like whether the pixel data is packed or padded, whether channels are swapped, etc.

There are 53 active profiles (54th raw entry, prefix 1044, disabled at load) covering known iPod/iPhone devices from 2004 through 2016.

## What's a Decoder?

A decoder is code that converts raw pixel data from one format to BGRA (blue, green, red, alpha — what ImageGlass displays). This project has 8 decoders:

| Decoder           | Used by iPod/iPhone                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| RGB565            | 16-bit RGB (5 bits red, 6 bits green, 5 bits blue)  |
| RGB555            | 15-bit RGB (5 bits per channel)                     |
| ReorderedRGB555   | Byte-swapped 15-bit RGB variant                     |
| UYVY              | YUV 4:2:2 (luminance + color difference, packed)    |
| YCbCr 4:2:0       | YUV with subsampled color (common in video)         |
| YUV422 Interlaced | Same as UYVY but stored as two interleaved fields   |
| CLCL              | Nibble-based chroma (compact Apple-specific format) |
| CL                | Per-pixel chroma (another Apple-specific format)    |

## What's SIMD?

SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is a technique where the CPU processes multiple pixels at once instead of one at a time. This makes decoding 4-6× faster. This project uses SSE2 (on x64 Intel/AMD CPUs) and NEON (on ARM64 CPUs like Apple Silicon and Raspberry Pi).

## What's PhotoDB?

The library can:

- **Read** the database, find all thumbnails, and decode them
- **Write** a new database from scratch (useful for syncing artwork back to an iPod without iTunes)
- **Check integrity** — validate that a database file is well-formed

## What's the CLI?

The `ithmb` CLI tool is a standalone binary that doesn't need ImageGlass. Build from source: `cargo build --release` in the repo root, then `./target/release/ithmb`. Then:

- `ithmb input.ithmb [output.png]` — decode a single .ithmb file to PNG (auto-detects format from extension)
- `ithmb --info input.ithmb` — print metadata (size, prefix, profile, frame count)
- `ithmb --list-profiles` — list all 53 active profiles (54th raw entry, prefix 1044, disabled at load) in a formatted table
- `ithmb --open input.ithmb` — open a PhotoDB/ArtworkDB container and extract all entries as numbered PNG files
- `ithmb --frame N input.ithmb [output.png]` — extract a specific frame from a multi-frame file
- `ithmb --raw input.ithmb [output.bin]` — output raw BGRA binary instead of PNG

## Output formats

The CLI produces PNG images by default (auto-detected from the `.png` output extension). Use `--raw` for raw BGRA binary output.

ImageMagick can convert BMP to anything else (`magick out.bmp out.png`). Or use `ithmb` directly to output PNG:

```
ithmb decode file.ithmb out.png
```
